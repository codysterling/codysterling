I received my PhD in Chemical Physics from Stockholm University in January 2023.  I have 7 years experience as a scientific researcher conducting molecular simulations of liquids and solid-state materials, and am skilled in QM and MM molecular dynamics, HF and DFT methods, and electronic structure calculations.

I am also comfortable programming in a few different languages -- especially Python, which I have used extensively for writing data analysis scripts.  Currently I am improving my C++ and machine learning skills.  Please feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cody-sterling).
